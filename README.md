# Network Traffic Analyzer: Unmask Anomalies in Your Network
## Tired of lurking threats hiding within your network traffic? This Python script empowers you to capture, analyze, and unmask potential security threats with ease. Say goodbye to the dark corners of your network and embrace transparency and security!

# What it does:

Captures network packets from your chosen interface.
Analyzes captured packets, extracting key information like source/destination IPs, protocols, and ports.
Detects anomalies based on predefined rules and thresholds, including:
High activity from specific IPs
Unusual traffic for certain protocols
Activity on common attack ports
Provides insights into your network traffic patterns, helping you identify potential security concerns.
Features:

# Simple and customizable: 

Easy to use with configurable capture settings and analysis parameters.
Powerful anomaly detection: Built-in rules and a framework for integrating machine learning for even more advanced threat identification.
Actionable insights: Gain valuable information about your network traffic to inform security decisions.
Getting started:

# Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-traffic-analyzer.git

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:
python main.py
Customize and enhance:

# Tune the rules and thresholds: 
Adapt them to your specific network environment and security needs.
Integrate machine learning: Train a model on labeled network traffic data for advanced anomaly detection.
Visualize results: Use libraries like Matplotlib to create insightful graphs and charts.
Take control of your network security! This script is your first step towards a proactive and informed approach to protecting your valuable data and systems.
